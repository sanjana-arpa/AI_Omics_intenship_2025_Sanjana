**AI and Omics Research Internship (2025)**

This repository contains my work during the AI and Omics Research Internship (2025), focusing on applying machine learning and deep learning to omics data (genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics).


**Module I: R Basic Operations**
Covers basics of R programing and how to perform basic functions for data analysis in R, such as
- Creating project folders and subdirectories for organized workflow in R.
- Imported the patient_info.csv dataset into R.
- Exploring different data types in R.
- Conversion of categorical variables to factors.


**Class 1C: R Basic Syntax**
- Covers the basics syntax of R programming such as variables, comments, keywords and
- essential functions such as if, if...else loops for data analysis


**Class 3B: Microarray Data Preprocessing in R**
Covers preprocessing of raw microarray data in R for downstream analysis using steps like:
- Installation of Bioconductor package in R
- RMA (Robust Multiarray Average) Normalization of raw data
- Quality check before and after normalization using arrayQuality package
- Low variance probe filtering
- Converting categorical data into factors to create groups (e.g. normal vs cancer)
